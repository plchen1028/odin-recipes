        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Here's how you can make a chinese nappa dish the traditional way.
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (2-3 lb / 1-1.2 kg) small head napa cabbage</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
                <li>4 chili peppers , dried</li>
                <li>1 inch ginger , minced</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic , minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chinkiang vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the leaves from the head of cabbage. Cut off the leafy green parts and save them in a ziplock bag for future use (*Footnote 1). Tilt your knife to slice the cabbage at a 45° angle into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces. (See blog post above for detailed pictures)</li>
                <li>Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and stir to mix well.</li>
                <li>In a large carbon steel skillet or a wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the dried chili peppers. Once the chilis start to brown, add the ginger, garlic, and green onions. Saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced cabbage and turn to high heat. Cook without moving for 30 seconds. Then saute for 2 minutes, or until the cabbage begins to soften but is still crunchy. Do not overcook the cabbage, which will cause it to release liquid and make the sauce watery.</li>
                <li>
                Immediately transfer everything to a big serving plate and serve it hot as a side dish.
                </li>
            </ol>
